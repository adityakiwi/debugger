The multiple solution proposals are as followed:

1. Following the best practices in software development. This includes:
- Keeping the code simple, maintainable.
- Using comments and clean, descriptive names for methods, classes and variables.
- Making sure that the code is safe, fail-proof and takes care of all possible edge cases.

2. Following the standard Design Patterns in development. For instance:
- Singleton pattern.
- Facade pattern.
- Observer pattern.

3. Adopting Code Refactoring techniques:
- Breaking down long methods into smaller methods.
- Replacing magic numbers with named constants.
- Utilizing looping constructs or mappings instead of multiple similar code lines.
